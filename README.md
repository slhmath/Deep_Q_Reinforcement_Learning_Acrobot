# Deep_Q_Reinforcement_Learning_Acrobot
We train a Deep Neural Network to estimate the optimal policy or Q(uality)-Values for an agent playing Acrobot-v1 in OpenAI Gym.

The agents 'goal' is to swing its two limbs so that the intermediate joint breaches the horizontal bar directly above it.
Here is a sample of the agent performing during the training phase:

After training is complete, the Deep Q-Network has discovered an approximate optimal policy. Below are examples of how the trained agent peforms on the first 4 test runs:
